.NET is a programming framework created by Microsoft that developers can use to create applications more easily.
.NET languages come in different flavours such as: 
C#.NET 
VB.NET 
F#. 

.NET languages compile to CIL (Common Intermediate Language) 
which means they all start "talking" the samelanguage and can therefore interoperate.
