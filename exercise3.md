# Adding more properties to our model

Now you know the basics, let's add something else..

Add a property in your model to save the image of the beer, this value will be optional and you will be storing only the path.

After update your model, you'll need to do the necesary modifications in your controller and views 
to allow display, edit and delete the image reference.

You can google how to get this done and if you need assistance we are here to help you.
