# Adding more properties to our model

Now you know the basics, let's add something else..

Add a property in your model to save the image of the beer, this value will be optional and you will be storing only the url. For example, you can grab some free image from internet and store the url for this workshop, then in the view you can assign that value to the [src attribute](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_src.asp) in an [img html tag](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp)

After update your model, you'll need to do the necesary modifications in your controller and views 
to show the newly added property, edit and delete it.

You can google how to get this done and if you need assistance we are here to help you.
